On June 8 and 9, Wichita reported 7.06 inches, Newton 5.75 inches, and Arkansas City 2.06 inches. Excessive precipitation fell over all of the Little Arkansas, Ninnescah, and Chikaskia River Basins as well as the Arkansas River Valley, and major flooding occurred on all of the affected streams. Wichita and Arkansas City were severely damaged. In Wichita, 6 square miles were inundated. At Arkansas City, two lives were lost, and property damage was estimated in the millions (Kansas Water Resources Board, 1960). Flood stages on the Ninnescah were the highest known.\n",
