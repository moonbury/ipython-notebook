In a GUI toolkit, each look might check to see if any clicks or button presses had occurred.\n",

    " * If ``True``, picking is enabled for the artist object and a ``pick_event`` will fire any time a mouse event occurs over the artist object in the figure.\n",
    " * If a number (e.g., ``float`` or ``int``), the value is interpreted as a \"tolerance\"; if the event's data (such as $x$ and $y$ values) is within the value of that tolerance, the ``pick_event`` will fire.\n",

In it, we create a data set of 100 arrays, each containing 1000 random numbers. The sample mean and standard deviation of each is determined, and a plot is made of the 100 means vs the 100 standard deviations. We then connect the line created by the plot command to the pick event, and plot the original (randomly generated) time series data corresponding to the \"picked\" points. If more than one point is within the tolerance of the clicked on point, we display multiple subplots for the time series which fall into our tolerance (in this case, 10 pixels)."

    "matplotlib backends come with a feature we haven't discussed yet: a widget for [interactive navigation](http://matplotlib.org/users/navigation_toolbar.html). This widget is available for all the backends (including the ``nbagg`` backend for IPython, when not in \"inline\" mode). In brief, the functionality associated with the buttons in the widget is as follows:\n",
    " * *Home*: returns the figure to its originally rendered state\n",
    " * *Previous*: return to the previous view in the plot's history\n",
    " * *Next*: move to the next view in the plot's history\n",
    " * *Pan/Zoom*: pan across the plot by clicking and holding the left mouse button; zoom by clicking and holding the right mouse button (behavior differs between Cartesian and Polar plots)\n",
    " * *Zoom-to-Rectangle*: zoom in on a selected portion of the plot\n",
    " * *Subplot Configuration*: configure the display of subplots via a pop-up widget with various parameters\n",
    " * *Save*: save the plot, in its currently displayed state, to a file\n",
    " \n",
    "When a toolbar action is engaged, the ``NavigationToolbar`` instance sets the current mode. For instance, when the *Zoom-to-Rectangle* button is clicked, the mode will be set to ``zoom rect``. When in *Pan/Zoom*, the mode will be set to ``pan/zoom``. These can be used in conjunction with the supported events to fire callbacks in response to toolbar activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In point of fact, the toolbar class, ``matplotlib.backend_bases.NavigationToolbar2`` is an excellent place to look for examples of \"compound events\". Let's examine the *Pan/Zoom* button. The class tracks the following via attributes that get set:\n",
    " * The connection id for a \"press\" event\n",
    " * The connection id for a \"release\" event\n",
    " * The connection id for a \"mouse move\" event (correlated to a mouse drag later)\n",
    " * Whether the toolbar is \"active\"\n",
    " * What the toolbar mode is\n",
    " * What the zoom mode is\n",
    "\n",
    "During toolbar setup, toolbar button events are connected to callbacks. When these buttons are pressed, and the callbacks are fired, old events are disconnected and new ones connected. In this way, chains of events may be set up with a particular sequence of events firing only a particular set of callbacks and in a particular order."
