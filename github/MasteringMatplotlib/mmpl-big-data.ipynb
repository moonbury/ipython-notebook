    "The term \"big data\" is semantically ambiguous due to the varying contexts to which it is applied and the motivations of those applying it. The first question that may have occurred to you upon seeing this chapter's title is \"how is this applicable to matplotlib or even plotting in general?\" Before we answer that question, though, let's establish a working definition of *big data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia article on big data opens with the following informal definition: \"Big data is a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate.\" This is a great place to start: it is honest, admitting to being imprecise; it also implies that the definition may change given differing contexts. The words \"large\" and \"complex\" are relative, and \"traditional data processing\" is not going to mean the same thing between different industry segments. In fact, different departments in a single organization may have widely varying data processing \"traditions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical example of big data relates to its origins in web search. Google is generally credited with starting the big data \"movement\" with the publication of the paper \"MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters\" by Dean and Ghemawat. The paper describes the means by which Google was able to quickly search an enormous volume of textual data (crawled web pages and log files, for example) amounting, in 2004, to around 20 TB. In the intervening decade, more and more companies, institutions, and even individuals are faced with the need to quickly process data sets varying in sizes from hundreds of gigabytes to multiples of exobytes. To the small business that used to manage hundreds of megabytes and is now facing several orders of magnitude in data sources for analysis, 250 gigabytes is \"big data.\" For intelligence agencies storing information from untold data sources, even a few terabytes is small; to them, big data is hundreds of petabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To each, though, the general problem remains the same: what worked before on smaller data sets is no longer feasible. New methodologies, new approaches to the use of hardware, communication protocols, data distribution, search, analysis, and visualization -- among many others -- are required. No matter which methodologies are used to support a big data project, one of the last steps in most of them is the presentation of digested data to human eyes. This could be anything from a decision maker to an end-user, but the need is the same: a visual representation of the data collected, searched, and analyzed. This is where tools like matplotlib come into play."

    "As stated in previous notebooks, matplotlib was originally designed for use on workstations and desktops, not servers. Its design did not arise from use cases for high-volume or large data sets. However, there are steps you can take that allow for matplotlib to be used in such situations. First, though, here's an overview of tools that *were* designed with large data sets in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/) -  an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application. ParaView was developed to analyze extremely large datasets using distributed memory computing resources. It can be run on supercomputers to analyze datasets of petascale size as well as on laptops for smaller data. Paraview also offers a Python scripting interface.\n",
    "* [VisIt](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit) -  an open source, interactive, scalable, visualization, animation and analysis tool. VisIt has a parallel and distributed architecture allowing users to interactively visualize and analyze data ranging in scale from small ($< 10^1$ core) desktop-sized projects to large ($> 10^5$ core) computing facility simulation campaigns. VisIt is capabable of visualizing data from over 120 different scientific data formats. VisIt offers a Python interface.\n",
    "* [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) - Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, but also deliver this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.\n",
    "* [Vispy](http://vispy.org/) - a new 2D and 3D high-performance visualization library which can handle very large data sets. Vispy uses the OpenGL library and GPUs for increased performance and with it, users are able to interactively explore plots having hundreds of millions of points. For now, knowledge of OpenGL is very helpful when using Vispy.\n",
    " \n",
    "However, all this being said, matplotlib is a powerful and well-known tool in the scientific computing community. Organizations and teams have uncountable years of cumulative experience building, installing, augmenting, and using matplotlib and the libraries of related projects like NumPy and SciPy. If there is a new way to put old tools to use without having to suffer the losses in productivity and re-engineering of infrastructure associated with platform changes, it is often in everyone's best interest to do so."

In this chapter, we will explore ways around some of the other limitations matplotlib users may run up against when working on problems with very large data sets. Note that this investigation will often cause us to bump up against the topic of clustering; we will be setting those explorations aside for now, though.

    "\n",
    "The [answer given](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14268804) by [Jeff Reback](http://stackoverflow.com/users/644898/jeff) was exceptional and is commonly referenced as *the* way to work with very large data sets in Pandas. The question was framed around a desire to move away from proprietary software which handled large data sets well, and the only thinking keeping this person from making the leap was not knowing how to process large data sets in Pandas and NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the scenario outlined, one can easily use tens of GB of file data using the high-performance [HDF5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) data structure. Pandas [provides documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/io.html#hdf5-pytables) on its use of HDF5 in the \"I/O\" section of its docs site. Jeff provides the following question to consider when defining a workflow for large data files in Pandas and NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the size of your data? What are the number of rows and columns? What are the types of columns? Are you appending rows, or just columns?\n",
    "2. What will typical operations look like? For example, will you be querying columns to select a bunch of rows and specific columns, then doing some in-memory operation, then maybe creating new columns, and finally saving these?\n",
    "3. After your typical set of operations, what will you do? In other words, is step #2 ad hoc, or repeatable? \n",
    "4. Roughly how many total GB are you expecting to process from your source data files? How are these organized? (E.g. by records?) Does each one contain different fields, or do they have some records per file with all of the fields in each file?\n",
    "5. Do you ever select subsets of rows (records) based on specified criteria (e.g. select the rows with field A > 5)? and then do something? Or do you just select fields A, B, C with all of the records (and *then* do something)?\n",
    "6. Do you need all of your columns -- as a group -- for all of your typical operations? Or is there a good proportion that you may only use for reports (e.g. you want to keep the data around, but don't need to pull in that column explicity until final results time)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeff's response boils down to a few core concepts:\n",
    " * creating a store\n",
    " * grouping your fields according to your needs\n",
    " * reading large file data in chunks, to prevent swamping system memory\n",
    " * reindexing the data (by chunks) and adding it to the store\n",
    " * selecting groups from all the chunks that have been saved in the store"

    "[Hierarchical Data Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) is a set of file formats (namely HDF4 and HDF5) originally developed at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications) to store and organize large amounts of numerical data. (Some may remember NCSA as the place where they downloaded their first graphical web browser, code which is the ancestor not only to the Netscape web browser, but also Internet Explorer. A web server was also created there, and this evolved into the Apache HTTP Server.)\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF is supported by Python, R, Julia, Java, Octave, IDL, and MATLAB, to name a few. HDF5 offers significant improvements and useful simplifications over HDF4. It uses B-trees to index table objects and, as such, works well for write-once/read-many time series data with common use occurring across fields such as meteorological studies, biosciences, the finance industry, and aviation. HDF5 files of multi-terabyte sizes are common in these applications, typically constructed from the analyses of multiple HDF5 source files, thus providing a single (and often extensive) source of grouped data for a particular application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PyTables](https://pytables.github.io/) library is built on top of the Python HDF5 library and NumPy, thus not only providing access to one of the most widely-used large-data file formats in the scientific computing community, but then links data extracted from these files with the data types and objects provided by the fast Python numerical processing library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas, in turn, wraps PyTables, thus extending its convenient in-memory data structures, functions, and objects to large on-disk files. To use HDF data with Pandas, you'll want to create a ``pd.HDFStore``, read from HDF data sources with ``pd.read_hdf``, or write to one with ``pd.to_hdf``.\n",
    "\n",
    "One project to keep an eye on is [Blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org/). It's an open wrapper and utility framework for working with large data sets, generalizing such actions creation, access, updates, and migration. Blaze supports not only HDF, but also SQL, CSV, and JSON. The API usage between Pandas and Blaze is very similar, if various methods are spelled differently. [This page](http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/rosetta.html) outlines the basics and is a good review. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below we will be using PyTables to create an HDF5 too large to comfortably fit in memory. We will follow these steps (for more details and to examine steps that we have left out, be sure to see Yves Hilpisch's presentation [Out-of-Memory Data Analytics with Python](http://hilpisch.com/TPQ_Out_of_Memory_Analytics.html)):\n",
    " * Create a series of CSV source data files taking up ~14 GB of disk space\n",
    " * Create an empty HDF5 file\n",
    " * Create a table in the HDF5 file, providing schema metadata and compression options\n",
    " * Load our CSV source data into the HDF5 table\n",
    " * Query our new data source, once the data has been migrated\n",

A MapReduce program is composed of a ``Map`` procedure that performs filtering and sorting, and a ``Reduce`` procedure that performs a summary operation. The \"MapReduce System\" orchestrates the processing by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.\n",

    "Between 1999 and 2004, Google had created hundreds of special-purpose computations for processing the huge amounts of data generated by web crawling, HTTP access logs, etc. The many kinds of processing developed were in large part used to create Google search's page ranked search results -- at the time, a vast improvement over other search engine results. Each computation required was pretty straight-forward; it was the combination of these which was unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the span of those five years, the computation tasks needed to be split across hundreds and then thousands of machines in order to finish in a timely manner. As such, the difficulties of parallelizing code were introduced: not only the decomposition of tasks into parallelizable parts, but the parallelization of data and hanlding failures. All of these combined with the legacy code being maintain (and created) made for an approach that was becoming less maintainable and growing more difficult to easily add new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspriation for a new approach to Google's problem came from the second oldest programming language still in use: Lisp (Fortan being the oldest). The authors of the Google MapReduce paper were reminded of the fact that many of their processing jobs consisted of a simple action against a data set (using a [modern Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LFE_(programming_language)) as an example):\n",

    "(4 5 2 7)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the \"folding\" of those results into a secondary analytical result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cl\n",
    "> (lists:foldl #'+/2 0 (4 5 2 7))\n",
    "18\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function above is called \"folding\" due to the fact that there is a recursive operation in place, with each item in the list being folded into an accumulator. In this case, the folding function is addition (with arity of \"2\", thus the ``+/2``); ``0`` is provided as an initial value for the first fold. Note that if our folding function created items in a list rather than adding two integers for a sum, the initial value would have been a list (empty or otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The map and fold operations can be combined in the fashion typical of higher-order functions:\n",

    "      (string:tokens data \" \")))\n",
    "18\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed by now (or known already), there is another term that folding is known. It is named not for the process by which it is created, but by the nature of the results it creates: *reduce*. In this case, a list of integers is reduced to a single value by means of the addition function we provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: given an initial data set, we've run a length function (with an arity of one) against every element of our data which has been split on the “space” character. Our results were integers representing the length of each word in our data set. Then, we folded our list with the + function, element at a time, into an “accumulator” with the initial value of zero. The end result represented the sum of all the elements. If we wanted a running average instead of a running sum, we would have supplied a different function: it still would take two arguments and it would still sum them, it would just divide that result by two:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The average word length in our data is 4.875 ASCII characters. This example makes more clear the latent power in solutions like these: for completely new results, we only needed to change one function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various Lisps and other functional programming languages have fold or reduce functionality, but this is not just the domain of functional programming: Python 3 has a library dedicated to functional programming idioms: ``functools``. Here's how the above examples would be implemented in Python 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> data = \"some words to examine\"\n",

    ">>> functools.reduce(operator.add, [4, 5, 2, 7], 0)\n",
    "18\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, these may be composed in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> functools.reduce(operator.add,\n",
    "...                  map(len, data.split(\" \")),\n",
    "...                  0)\n",
    "18\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And to calculate the running average:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def ave(number, accum):\n",
    "...     return (number + accum) / 2\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> functools.reduce(ave,\n",
    "...                  map(len, data.split(\" \")),\n",
    "...                  0)\n",
    "4.875\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The really important part to realize here -- given the context of Google's needs in 2004 and the later fluorescence of MapReduce -- is that each ``map`` call of ``len`` is independent of all the others. These could be called on the same machine in the same process, or in *different processes*, on *different cores*, or on *another machine altogether* (given the appropriate framework, of course). In a similar fashion, the data provided to the ``reduce`` function could be from any number of sources, local or remote. In fact, the reduce step could be split across multiple computational resources -- it would just need a final reduce step to aggregate all the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight led to an innovation in the development process at Google in support of the tasks which had steadily gown in complexity and reduced maintainability. They created infrastructure such that engineers only needed to create their own mapper and reducer functions, and then these could be run against the desired data sources on the appropriate MapReduce clusters. This automated the parallelization of tasks and distribution of workload across any number of servers running in Google's large computation clusters in their data centers."

A member project of the Apache Software Foundation, Hadoop is an open source distributed storage and processing framework designed to work with very large data sets on commodity hardware computing clusters. The distributed storage part of the project is called HDFS, Hadoop Distributed File System, and the processing part is named MapReduce. When a user uploads data to the Hadoop file system, the files are split into pieces and then distributed across the cluster nodes. When a user creates a code to run on Hadoop MapReduce, the custom mappers and reducers – similar in concept to what we saw in the previous section – are copied to MapReduce nodes in the cluster which are then executed for against the data stored in with that node.\n",

That was the birth of Hadoop.

They wanted their researchers – many of them proficient in Python – to be able to easily and quickly create MapReduce jobs against their large data sets. They also needed their system to be fault-tolerant and scalable. As such, they built the server on top of the Erlang distributed programming language, and created a protocol and Python client which could talk to it, thus allowing their users to continue using the language they new so well.\n",

    "The functionality of MapReduce is no longer available only in the domain of MapReduce frameworks: the rise of NoSQL databases which then extended their functionality to distributed data have started offering MapReduce features in their products. Redis clusters, for instance, make it trivial to implement MapReduce functionality. The Riak distributed NoSQL key-value data store, based upon the Amazon Dynamo paper (not to be confused with the DynamoDB product from Amazon), offers built-in MapReduce capabilities. Riak provides an API  for executing MapReduce jobs against nodes in a cluster, and this is supported by the Python Riak client library. MongoDB is another NoSQL database which offers built-in support for MapReduce.\n",

In particular, we will take advantage of a service provider which allows us to quickly and easily set up Hadoop clusters: Amazon Elastic MapReduce, or EMR."

    "The most important thing to keep in mind when working with large data sets and matplotlib is this: use the data wisely and take advantage of NumPy. As we saw, even with data sets approaching billions of points, matplotlib's use of NumPy was intelligent and didn't do anything untoward under the hood: when we used ``memmap``, matplotlib used it. More importantly, in the early art of this notebook we decided to plot the histogram, not the entire data set. A little discernment on our part went a long way and made matplotlib highly usable even under circumstances that it was never designed to handle."
